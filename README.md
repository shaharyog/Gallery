# Gallery Frontend

This is a simple GUI (Graphical User Interface) for a gallery application developed in Flutter. The application allows users to view and manage photos and albums in a gallery system. It serves as a quick GUI implementation and is a modified version of a previously developed console application that has been rewritten as a server-based solution.


## Features
